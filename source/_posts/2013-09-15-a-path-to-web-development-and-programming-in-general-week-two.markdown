I will cover the above aspects in a tutorial post within a couple of days. Till then, we all have decided to continue playing around with HTML5 & CSS3 until Wednesday to get our basics right.
So for now, complete the <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web">Codecedemy's Web Fundamental track </a> and <a href="http://freecourses.tutsplus.com/30-days-to-learn-html-and-css/">the Netuts HTML & CSS</a>. Get on with it!
